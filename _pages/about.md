Hey there! I'm a Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University studying theoretical particle physics. I’m currently a [MCgen](https://mcgenednet.github.io) fellow at the University of Cincinnati.

Neutrino experiments have entered a precision era: they now measure Standard Model parameters with remarkable accuracy, while also providing unique opportunities to test new physics in the neutrino sector and to probe a wide range of beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) scenarios. I am a theoretical physicist working at this intersection, with the goal of uncovering BSM physics through neutrino experiments and other intensity-frontier facilities. As a phenomenologist, I aim
to bridge the gap between experiment and theory—developing models motivated by experimental anomalies, and designing strategies to test theory predictions against data.
